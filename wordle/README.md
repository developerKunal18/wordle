# 🎮 Wordle Game – Terminal Edition (Python Project )

## 💡 Overview
This project is a Python-based terminal clone of the viral game **Wordle**.  
The player must guess a hidden 5-letter word in 6 attempts while receiving feedback using emoji-based hints — just like the original Wordle game.

This version runs entirely in the **terminal**, uses **no external libraries**, and is highly customizable.  
It's a great beginner-intermediate Python project involving logic, loops, condition checking, and user interaction.
